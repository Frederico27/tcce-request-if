# Transaction Rejection with Reason - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a feature that requires users to provide a rejection reason before rejecting a transaction via Telegram. This ensures proper documentation and accountability for all transaction rejections.

## Changes Made

### 1. **TelegramWebhookController.php** 
Location: `app/Http/Controllers/TelegramWebhookController.php`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `Cache` facade import for temporary state storage
- ‚úÖ Modified `handleWebhook()` to handle reply messages
- ‚úÖ Added `handleReplyMessage()` method to process user text replies
- ‚úÖ Added `promptRejectReason()` method to prompt users for rejection reason
- ‚úÖ Modified `rejectTransaction()` to accept and save rejection reason
- ‚úÖ Added `rejectTransactionWithReason()` helper method
- ‚úÖ Changed rejection flow from one-click to two-step (prompt ‚Üí reply ‚Üí execute)

**Key Logic:**
```php
// When user clicks Reject button:
1. Check if transaction is still pending
2. Store rejection context in cache (10-minute expiry)
3. Send prompt message asking for reason
4. Wait for user reply

// When user replies with reason:
1. Retrieve context from cache
2. Update transaction with rejection status and reason
3. Update original message to show rejection with reason
4. Send confirmation message
```

### 2. **TelegramService.php**
Location: `app/Services/TelegramService.php`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `sendMessageWithReply()` method
- ‚úÖ Implements Telegram's `force_reply` feature to make responding easy

**New Method:**
```php
public function sendMessageWithReply(string $chatId, string $message, int $replyToMessageId): bool
```

### 3. **Transactions.php** (Model)
Location: `app/Models/Transactions.php`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `rejection_reason` to the `$fillable` array

### 4. **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Created `TELEGRAM_REJECTION_REASON.md` - Complete feature documentation
- ‚úÖ Updated `TELEGRAM_INTEGRATION.md` - Added references to rejection reason feature

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Click Reject Button** ‚Üí User clicks ‚ùå Reject on transaction notification
2. **Receive Prompt** ‚Üí Bot sends message: "Please provide a reason for rejecting this transaction"
3. **Reply with Reason** ‚Üí User replies to the prompt with their reason
4. **Transaction Rejected** ‚Üí Transaction is rejected with the reason stored and displayed

### Technical Flow
```
User clicks Reject
    ‚Üì
promptRejectReason() called
    ‚Üì
Store context in Cache (transaction_id, user_name, chat_id, message_id)
    ‚Üì
Send prompt message with force_reply
    ‚Üì
User replies to message
    ‚Üì
handleReplyMessage() called
    ‚Üì
Retrieve context from Cache
    ‚Üì
rejectTransactionWithReason() called
    ‚Üì
Update transaction: status=rejected, rejection_reason, rejected_by, rejected_at
    ‚Üì
Update original message with rejection details
    ‚Üì
Send confirmation message
```

## Database Schema
The `rejection_reason` field already existed in the database:
```sql
rejection_reason VARCHAR(255) NULLABLE
```

## Cache Usage
- **Key Pattern**: `telegram_reject_{chatId}_{messageId}`
- **Expiry**: 10 minutes
- **Purpose**: Store temporary context between button click and text reply
- **Data Stored**: transaction_id, user_name, chat_id, message_id

## Benefits
1. ‚úÖ **Accountability**: All rejections now have documented reasons
2. ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Rejection reasons are stored in database and displayed in messages
3. ‚úÖ **Transparency**: Users can see why transactions were rejected
4. ‚úÖ **History**: Rejection reasons are visible in transaction views
5. ‚úÖ **Simple UX**: Uses Telegram's force_reply for easy user response

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Click Reject button and verify prompt appears
- [ ] Reply with reason and verify transaction is rejected
- [ ] Verify rejection reason appears in updated message
- [ ] Verify confirmation message is sent
- [ ] Test with already processed transaction
- [ ] Test cache expiration (wait 11+ minutes)
- [ ] Check database to ensure rejection_reason is saved
- [ ] Verify rejection reason appears in web interface

## Files Modified

## Breaking Changes
‚ö†Ô∏è **None** - The approval flow remains unchanged. Only rejection now requires additional input.

## Backward Compatibility
‚úÖ **Fully Compatible** - Existing approved/rejected transactions are not affected. Web interface rejections continue to work as before (they already had rejection_reason support).

## Next Steps
1. Test the feature in development/staging environment
2. Clear application cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
3. Monitor webhook logs during testing
4. Consider adding validation for minimum rejection reason length
5. Consider adding rejection reason templates/quick replies

## Support
- See [TELEGRAM_REJECTION_REASON.md](TELEGRAM_REJECTION_REASON.md) for complete documentation
- Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for webhook errors
- Use Telegram's getWebhookInfo to verify webhook status
